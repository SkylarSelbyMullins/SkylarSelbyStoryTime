Skylar Selby's Story Part 2

A very happy dog played with his friend today.
They chased the Mail Man, played fetch, and got belly rubs.
At the end of the day the happy dog's friend had to go home.
This made the happy dog sad.
So now the happy dog was instead a sad dog.

The End...

Or is it?

Dun Dun Dun...
