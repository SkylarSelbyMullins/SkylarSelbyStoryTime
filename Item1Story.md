Skylar Selby's First Story

There once was a girl who lived in a tall tower.
The tower was surrounded by water, so a bridge was built to connect the tower to land.
The girl had many enemies, and one day a silver archer appeared.
His arrows were made of metal, so the girl used magnets to stop the arrows in the air.
After all this drama, the tower hit a string of bad luck.
First thousands of bugs infested the lower floors, and the girl was trapped in the top.
Then a shooting star crashed into the tower, and destroyed the building.
All that was left standing was a single clock.
